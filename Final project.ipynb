       "605302  Wonderful! We stopped in twice while taking our son to UP. Both the bacon & non-bacon (lol at the name) breakfast sandwiches were delicious. Not being huge poached eggs fans (& eating in our car) we wanted them poached hard. Even though the eggs were pre-made and couldn't be made poached hard, they did offer to try to cook them a little extra. \\n\\nSecond trip we had a vegan sandwich which was also amazing. Took a croissant a d chocolatetine to go. Also great. Now sitting here in the airport with an adorable box of cookies to bring home for the daughter who didn't get to come along. \\n\\nWe will definitely be back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

Edible Flowers, gorgeous dishes, beautiful bright and colorful layers stacked high, etc. was just not a thing in Portland.

Turns out, Proud Mary is from Melbourne, and everything made sense.\\n\\nI got to hear beautiful accents all around me, eat my Vegemite on toast, drink delicious coffee, sit in a gorgeous restaurant, and eat beautiful food. I got to escape for a bit, and I felt like I was back on the other side of the world. \\n\\nI'm still waiting for the edible floral and fruit stacked pancakes that I have yet to find in America, but I will wait.

       "605295  Ever since I returned from Australia, I wondered why restaurants here didn't go above and beyond on food presentation the way that the Aussies did. Edible Flowers, gorgeous dishes, beautiful bright and colorful layers stacked high, etc. was just not a thing in Portland. There is something about it that makes the dining experience just a bit more pleasant, and as soon as I heard about Proud Mary, I felt those same nostalgic Australian vibes. Turns out, Proud Mary is from Melbourne, and everything made sense.\\n\\nI got to hear beautiful accents all around me, eat my Vegemite on toast, drink delicious coffee, sit in a gorgeous restaurant, and eat beautiful food. I got to escape for a bit, and I felt like I was back on the other side of the world. \\n\\nI'm still waiting for the edible floral and fruit stacked pancakes that I have yet to find in America, but I will wait. I know they'll come. As for what I did have, delicious. I am praying for more and more vegan items to show up on the menu, but I like the options we've been given thus far. \\n\\nGood on ya                                                                                          \n",
       "605296  It's a super solid coffee shop. You could tell how good their coffee is just by the amount of people waiting in line at 9 in the morning, and there aren't any other places nearby that are worth stopping by either. The inside is very unique and gives a slightly \"rugged\" vibe (?). I ordered a chai latte, and I really liked it. It's on the milkier side, and even watered down, it's still good. My friend ordered an iced vanilla latte, and it's also on the creamier side. I preferred my chai latte. I love how they're handling COVID (only one customer inside at a time). They also have delicious pastries. I would definitely come back again!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

I entered without looking at yelp initially but then after checking in and seeing the amount of stars I kind of grew the assumption that it wasn't going to be good.  But it was really good. This was probably the best falafel wrap I ever had. They pressed the wrap too so it has a nice crunch but still soft to chew. The falafels weren't bland and each bite tasted the same, which makes wraps great, since it's evenly disturbed. \\n\\nThey are far from cheap on the stuffing so eat up! The wait time wasn't long during their busy time and it's a good portion for a hungry person, so I suggest checking this place out.</td>\n",

I know coffee, am passionate about coffee, and Im always looking for the best roaster out there.  George Howell is a legend but the coffee here is honestly not that impressive.\\n\\nOne story - I ordered an Ethiopian pour over and asked for it to be made on the machine instead of by hand as I wanted to watch the machine in action. I paid $4 with my CC. I was then told that they don't have any Ethiopian but they would make me Kenyan which is very similar (not in my opinion but ok I'll go with it - there was Ethiopian on the shelf so I'm a little confused... why can you just go grab it and make it for me? That is what I ordered.)  Next I'm told they can't use the machine because it isn't on. Long story short I get my coffee after 10 minutes. And after drinking it I am never asked how it was, if I was ok with them switching out the coffee I ordered.  I don't know about you but I expect more. \\n\\nI've decided that my coffee money is better spent elsewhere supporting people and roasters that are starting out. Sorry George, but ya let me down.</td>\n",

That's a bit long for a drink.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "7   Falafel wrap - falafel with greens, pickles, and hummus in  a toasted wrap. I wonder why the reviews were so low. I entered without looking at yelp initially but then after checking in and seeing the amount of stars I kind of grew the assumption that it wasn't going to be good.  But it was really good. This was probably the best falafel wrap I ever had. They pressed the wrap too so it has a nice crunch but still soft to chew. The falafels weren't bland and each bite tasted the same, which makes wraps great, since it's evenly disturbed. \\n\\nThey are far from cheap on the stuffing so eat up! The wait time wasn't long during their busy time and it's a good portion for a hungry person, so I suggest checking this place out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "8   If this isn't your first time at the specialty coffee rodeo and if you know you're way around a pour over, burr grinder, and espresso machine then most likely you will be slightly annoyed that the baristas talk to you like you've never heard of pour over and that they are the only place in Boston that serves good specialty coffee. I know coffee, am passionate about coffee, and Im always looking for the best roaster out there.  George Howell is a legend but the coffee here is honestly not that impressive.\\n\\nOne story - I ordered an Ethiopian pour over and asked for it to be made on the machine instead of by hand as I wanted to watch the machine in action. I paid $4 with my CC. I was then told that they don't have any Ethiopian but they would make me Kenyan which is very similar (not in my opinion but ok I'll go with it - there was Ethiopian on the shelf so I'm a little confused... why can you just go grab it and make it for me? That is what I ordered.)  Next I'm told they can't use the machine because it isn't on. Long story short I get my coffee after 10 minutes. And after drinking it I am never asked how it was, if I was ok with them switching out the coffee I ordered.  I don't know about you but I expect more. \\n\\nI've decided that my coffee money is better spent elsewhere supporting people and roasters that are starting out. Sorry George, but ya let me down.   \n",
       "9   I ate here recently on the recommendations of some Muslim brothers at the Islamic Society of Boston (beautiful masjid). They said it was halal and the Arab owners confirmed that it was. This is a nice, downtown spot across the street from the park and right next to the Park Street subway station.\\n\\nWe enjoyed the chicken kabob and baked haddock dinners, which both came with rice and salad. Very enjoyable, hot and fresh food. When I went to buy some rice pudding for dessert, the owner gave it to us for free. What a nice touch.

       "12  Great spot. Comfortable little joint smack dab in the middle of Harvard Square. Drop in on a hot day and grab a bubble tea while shootin' the breeze with the staff. You can also challenge Harvard students to a game of Street Fighter 2 if you feel the need, but personally I like to just relax and keep the peace. \\n\\nThe only place that rivals this is a bubble tea shop in Calgary that I walked into awkwardly while they were still under construction. They told me to come back in and gave me a free bubble tea though so they are scoring points stricly on being nice and not charging anything (I still tipped though, I'm not a scumbag.) \\n\\nBoston Tea Stop (clever name especially with the MBTA map on the wall) is a valuable addition to the ever diminishing Harvard Square area. Pretty soon that neighborhood will be nothing but boring chain restaurants and mediocre bars so try and support the little guys while you can. \\n\\nAlso the staff deserves a shout-out.
